# Documentation Fabric and the semantic layer

*Feature notes split out of the root `CLAUDE.md` on 4 Oct 2026, verbatim. Shared rules (method, quality bar, invariants, cloud shape, identity, gateway, approvals, observability) stay in the root file.*

## Semantic Layer (`src/lab/core/semantic/`, served by `semantic-mcp` :9200)

Vocabularies as **data**, not prose: a `Vocabulary` (classes with layer/aspect facets and
definitions, relation types, the permitted source→relation→target matrix, modelling rules)
renders to RDF; a `Registry` holds many; a `SemanticStore` (rdflib, in-process, named graphs)
holds vocabularies + instance models and answers SPARQL over all of them. ArchiMate 3.1 is the
first vocabulary: `src/lab/core/semantic/archimate/taxonomy.json` (classification, distilled from the cheat
sheet) + `archi-relationships.xml` (Archi's machine-readable complete Appendix B matrix, 62
concepts / 3,844 pairs, letter key in `vocab.py`). Add a vocabulary = a JSON/XML data file +
a `build()`; add a question = a SPARQL template in `service.QUESTIONS`.

- **Why not vector search**: the cheat sheet is a taxonomy + a relationship matrix — tables and
  rules, not prose at scale. Deterministic lookup/validation beats retrieval, and Ollama Cloud has
  no embedding models anyway. Vector stores stay reserved for large text corpora later.
- **Derivation** (`model_rdf.py`): structural chains derive the weakest relation; structural
  chain + dependency derives that dependency (`am:derivedRealization`, `am:derivedServing`…).
  This is what makes "which goals are realized by components on node X" answerable.
- **The skill engine uses it**: `validate_relations()` is exact (full matrix + interface-exposure
  semantics) when `src/lab/core/semantic/` is importable, coarse otherwise; every exported element's
  documentation is prefixed with its `[Layer · aspect — Type]` classification.
- **Interfaces have their strict meaning**: an interface is the access point of a service —
  `Composition owner→interface` plus **`Assignment interface→service`**; a consumed service without
  an assigned interface is a warning. Functions are the decomposition unit (component assigned
  to function, function realizes service); business channels are `BusinessInterface`s realized by
  the `ApplicationInterface` that implements them.
- **Reference models are a second KIND of vocabulary — SKOS concept schemes** (`src/lab/core/semantic/skos.py`,
  `src/lab/core/semantic/reference/baguild.py`): the BA Guild Healthcare Provider v2.0 and Insurance v5.0
  models are loaded from their ORIGIN workbooks (capability map L1–L4 with tiers, value streams,
  and — insurance — organisation, stakeholder and information maps). The workbooks are licensed:
  they live in `var/reference-sources/` (git-ignored) or `REFERENCE_MODELS_DIR`; only derived
  RDF exists at runtime. Same-label top capabilities across schemes are linked by
  `skos:exactMatch` in a mappings graph — schemes are never merged. Stable concept ids are
  hashes of the full label path (the workbooks carry no ids).
- **Writing reference capabilities into ADOIT is a two-server operation**: `semantic-mcp`
  `semantic_export_archimate(scheme, root_label, depth)` projects a subtree to an ArchiMate spec
  (Capability + Composition, an L1 overview view in rows, one nested view per top concept —
  capability maps nest by convention, the one sanctioned use of containers); then `adoit-mcp`
  `archimate_render` + `ea_stage_import` render and stage it for approval like any model.
  `scripts/export_capabilities.py <scheme> [root] [depth]` runs that chain via the gateway.
- **Placement**: `semantic-mcp` is a separate, credential-free, read-only server granted to every
  team; `adoit-mcp` stays the governed EA-repository facade. Both import the same package.
